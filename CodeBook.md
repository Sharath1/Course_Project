The following are the columns in the final data set, the data set can be better understood by going through the code book

Descriptive fields
===============================
1 Subj_ID - The individual ID used to denote a subject or a participant of the experiment
2 activity - The name of the activity that the participant was doing when the measure was captured
===============================
Measures
The measures are fairly descriptive- the measures starting with Time are time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency domain signals
The -X, -Y, -Z are used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
